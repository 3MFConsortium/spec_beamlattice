# Preface

## 1.1. About this Specification

This 3MF beam lattice specification is an extension to the core 3MF specification. This document cannot stand alone and only applies as an addendum to the core 3MF specification. Usage of this and any other 3MF extensions follow an a la carte model, defined in the core 3MF specification.

Part I, &quot;3MF Documents,&quot; presents the details of the primarily XML-based 3MF Document format. This section describes the XML markup that defines the composition of 3D documents and the appearance of each model within the document.

Part II, &quot;Appendixes,&quot; contains additional technical details and schemas too extensive to include in the main body of the text as well as convenient reference information.

The information contained in this specification is subject to change. Every effort has been made to ensure its accuracy at the time of publication.

This extension MUST be used only with Core specification 1.x.

## 1.2. Document Conventions

Except where otherwise noted, syntax descriptions are expressed in the ABNF format as defined in RFC 4234.

Glossary terms are formatted like _this_.

Syntax descriptions and code are formatted in `monospace.` type.

Replaceable items, that is, an item intended to be replaced by a value, are formatted in _`monospace cursive`_ type.

Notes are formatted as follows:

>**Note:** This is a note.

## 1.3. Language Notes

In this specification, the words that are used to define the significance of each requirement are written in uppercase. These words are used in accordance with their definitions in RFC 2119, and their respective meanings are reproduced below:

- _MUST._ This word, or the adjective &quot;REQUIRED,&quot; means that the item is an absolute requirement of the specification.
- _SHOULD._ This word, or the adjective &quot;RECOMMENDED,&quot; means that there may exist valid reasons in particular circumstances to ignore this item, but the full implications should be understood and the case carefully weighed before choosing a different course.
- _MAY._ This word, or the adjective &quot;OPTIONAL,&quot; means that this item is truly optional. For example, one implementation may choose to include the item because a particular marketplace or scenario requires it or because it enhances the product. Another implementation may omit the same item.

## 1.4.Software Conformance

Most requirements are expressed as format or package requirements rather than implementation requirements.

In order for consumers to be considered conformant, they must observe the following rules:

- They MUST NOT report errors when processing conforming instances of the document format except when forced to do so by resource exhaustion.
- They SHOULD report errors when processing non-conforming instances of the document format when doing so does not pose an undue processing or performance burden.

In order for producers to be considered conformant, they must observe the following rules:

- They MUST NOT generate any new, non-conforming instances of the document format.
- They MUST NOT introduce any non-conformance when modifying an instance of the document format.

Editing applications are subject to all of the above rules.



# Part I: 3MF Documents

# Chapter 1. Overview of Additions

 ![Lattice image](beamlattice_image1.png)

This document describes new elements, each of which is OPTIONAL for producers, but MUST be supported by consumers that specify support for this beam lattice extension of 3MF.

The central idea of this extension is to enrich the geometry notion of 3MF with beam lattice elements that can represent small-scale lattices as well as larger truss structures â€“ both of which are quite inefficient to handle with a mesh representation, especially in cases where the element count grows into large numbers.

In order to find a balance between implementation complexity and capabilities, in this version of the specification all lattice beams are required to have a circular cross section. This reduces anisotropy issues that would be introduced by non-rotational geometries. Any additional capabilities MAY be handled by further (either public or private) extensions.

While this is meant to be an exact specification of the lattice geometry, and consumers MUST interpret it as such, the intent is also for applications in which editors can use the data structures for efficient interoperability and post processing the geometry in an intermediate step.

A producer using the lattice specification MUST mark the extension as required, as described in the core specification.
